              "\"If a person has a wound in one of the areas normally washed during wudu', they should perform wudu' as usual, except for the wounded area. Instead of washing the wound, they should perform tayammum, which is a dry ablution using clean earth or sand. It is important to note that the sand should not be placed directly on the wound itself, but rather on another part of the body. This ruling is based on the understanding that washing the wound may cause harm or delay the healing process. The reference for this ruling is Al-Mughni ma'a al-Sharh il-Kabeer 1/282.\""
